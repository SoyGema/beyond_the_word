## NOTES

Finetuning a model like BERT on a specific dataset and then performing an adversarial attack on that same dataset has implications for the adversarial attack scenario:

Model Familiarity with Data: When you finetune BERT on a dataset, the model becomes better at understanding and predicting the labels for that specific dataset. This means that the model has a stronger baseline accuracy to begin with on this dataset, making it potentially harder for adversarial attacks to succeed.

Shift in Decision Boundaries: Finetuning can shift the decision boundaries of the model to better fit the specific dataset. Adversarial attacks exploit these decision boundaries to mislead the model. Thus, the efficacy of a given adversarial attack strategy might differ between the pretrained model and the finetuned model.

Overfitting Concerns: If the model is overfitted to the dataset, it might be more susceptible to adversarial attacks. An overfitted model is very confident in its predictions for the training data but might falter when small perturbations are added.

Knowledge of Model Behavior: If you're using the same dataset for finetuning and for adversarial attacks, you have the advantage of knowing the model's behavior on this data. This can be both good and bad. Good because you have a clear benchmark of the model's performance without adversarial interference. Bad because, in a real-world scenario, attackers might not have this luxury, making the evaluation slightly unrealistic.

Evaluation Consistency: Attacking the model on the same dataset it was finetuned on provides a consistent evaluation metric. The attack's success can be directly compared to the model's original accuracy on the dataset.

Potential Bias: If the adversarial attack strategies are designed or tweaked based on insights from the finetuning dataset, they might be over-optimized for that particular dataset. This means that the attack might perform exceptionally well on this dataset but might not generalize as effectively to other datasets.

In summary, finetuning BERT on a specific dataset and then attacking it on the same dataset can provide valuable insights into the model's vulnerabilities in a specific context. However, it's also essential to consider how the attack might generalize to other datasets or in real-world scenarios where the attacker might not have intimate knowledge of the model's training data.


cially one as substantial as between BERT (110M parameters) and Falcon (7B parameters), can significantly influence adversarial attacks in several ways:

Model Complexity and Expressiveness: Larger models like Falcon with 7B parameters have greater capacity to understand and represent intricate patterns in data. This increased expressiveness can make them more resilient to certain adversarial attacks, especially simple ones, because they might have already implicitly learned representations that are robust against these perturbations.

Overfitting and Generalization: Bigger models are more prone to overfitting if not trained properly. If Falcon is overfitted to a specific dataset, it could be more susceptible to adversarial perturbations on that dataset. On the flip side, if properly regularized and trained, the larger model could also generalize better, making it harder to attack.

Decision Boundaries: Larger models, due to their complexity, have more intricate decision boundaries. The nature of these boundaries can affect how adversarial examples are generated. For instance, if Falcon's decision boundaries are smoother or less convoluted than BERT's, it might be harder to find effective perturbations that lead to misclassifications.

Computation and Efficiency: Generating adversarial examples against larger models like Falcon will be computationally more intensive than against smaller models like BERT. This means you might need more computational resources and time to perform the same number of attacks.

Transferability of Attacks: Adversarial examples generated for one model might not always be effective against another model. However, larger models, due to their capacity, might share more similarities in their learned representations with other models. This could make adversarial examples generated against Falcon more transferable to other models, but this is highly contextual and can vary based on the specific models and their training.

Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning: Larger models are often more effective when fine-tuned on a specific task, as they can leverage their vast pre-trained knowledge. If Falcon is fine-tuned for a particular task, its vulnerabilities might differ from its pre-trained state, and these vulnerabilities can be different from those of a model like BERT.

Embeddings and Input Representations: The way larger models process and represent inputs might be more refined or complex than smaller models. This can influence how input perturbations (adversarial attacks) affect the model's output.

In conclusion, while larger models like Falcon have the potential to be more robust against adversarial attacks due to their increased complexity and capacity, they also come with their own set of vulnerabilities and challenges. The effectiveness of adversarial attacks will depend on the specific characteristics of the model, its training regimen, and the nature of the attacks themselves.


### WHY FINETUNE FALCON

Advantages of Fine-tuning Falcon:

Task Specificity: By fine-tuning Falcon on a specific task, you're tailoring the model to be more proficient at that particular task. This will give you insights into its vulnerabilities in a more specialized context, which could be closer to a real-world scenario.

Understanding Transferability: After fine-tuning, adversarial examples crafted for the fine-tuned model might or might not transfer to the original pre-trained model. This can give insights into the transferability of attacks.

Comparative Analysis: You can compare the resilience of the original model and the fine-tuned version against adversarial attacks, giving insights into how fine-tuning impacts adversarial robustness.

Considerations for Fine-tuning:

Computational Costs: Fine-tuning a large model like Falcon can be resource-intensive.

Potential Overfitting: If not done carefully, fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small. Overfitted models might show different vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks than well-generalized models.

Dataset Availability: You need a relevant dataset for fine-tuning. The quality and size of this dataset can influence the fine-tuning process and, consequently, the adversarial robustness of the fine-tuned model.


Attacks on Original Falcon Model:

For the original, pre-trained Falcon model:

Black-box Attacks: Given that Falcon is a large model, gradient-based white-box attacks can be computationally expensive. You might want to consider black-box attacks, where you don't necessarily need internal knowledge of the model. Methods like substitute models or genetic algorithms can be effective.

Transfer Attacks: Craft adversarial examples using a smaller model (like BERT) and test their effectiveness on Falcon. Given Falcon's size and potential overlap in learned representations with other models, there's a chance that some adversarial examples might transfer.

Model-specific Vulnerabilities: Large models might have specific vulnerabilities or biases based on their training data. Exploratory attacks, aiming to uncover these biases or specific weak points, can be useful.

Universal Adversarial Perturbations: Instead of instance-specific perturbations, try crafting perturbations that are effective across a broad set of inputs.

In conclusion, whether or not to fine-tune Falcon depends on your objectives. If you're interested in understanding its vulnerabilities in a specific context or task, fine-tuning is a good idea. Otherwise, if you're more interested in its general adversarial robustness, you can attack the original model directly. Always consider the computational costs and data availability when deciding.
